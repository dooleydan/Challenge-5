# Challenge-5
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I missed a week of classes due to Covid and am not caught up on any of what we've learned for challenges 4 and 5. This is just due tonight and it's better to submit something rather than nothing.
